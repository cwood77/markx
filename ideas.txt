A new cdw markup language.  How would that work?

Today, files are read, edited, then written (update operation).  A *transform* is significantly different in that a different language is written out, and maybe with a different file format.

Linguistic concepts (i.e. model changes) for UPDATE:
- TOC **
  - TOC formatting
- citations **
  - formatting

Linguistic concepts (i.e. model changes) for TRANSFORM:
- #include for HTML script
- boldface
- italics
- tables
  - formatting
- ordered lists
- unordered lists
- images
  - formatting
- designer notes **
  - formatting

** Since markdown can't handle comments, these are sensitive in parsing.  Maybe programmable/customizable
